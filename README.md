# Module 9 Weekly Challenge - Professional README Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

In this challenge we were required to generate a professional README file. This tool is very handy as it streamlines the process in creating a README for any project!

## Installation

Download the repository files to your computer, and extract the zipped files to a dedicated folder.

## Usage

Navigate to the repository a git bash shell (or equivalent), and type "node index.js". This will result in a series of prompts appearing in the shell, asking for information to fill in each section of the README.

Most of these will be text inputs, but one will require you to select a repository license from a list of five options. Use the arrow keys to navigate up and down the list, and press enter to select the license you wish to use. If you do not wish to use a license, select the sixth option, "None", at the bottom.

Once all the questions have been answered, the application will begin generating the README. If the process was successful, a message stating as such will be printed to the shell, and the data will be saved to a markdown file README.md, which you can find in the repository's main folder.
